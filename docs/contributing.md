# Contributing

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox.git
cd yolobox
make build
make test
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.23+
- Docker or Podman for runtime and image testing

If you are working on the docs site branch, you also need Node.js to build the VitePress site.

yolobox release images set npm's `min-release-age` to 7 days. If you install npm dependencies while developing locally and want to mirror the release-image behavior, use:

```bash
npm install --min-release-age=7
```

## Development commands

```bash
make build
make test
make lint
make image
make install
```

For docs site work:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run docs:build
```

## Expectations

- follow the repo guidance in `AGENTS.md`
- add tests for code changes
- run the relevant verification before committing
- keep documentation aligned with shipped behavior
- update the [changelog](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for release-worthy changes

## Pull requests

1. create a branch
2. make the change
3. run the relevant verification
4. if you changed docs, build the docs site
5. open a PR with a clear description

## Reporting issues

Include:

- operating system and version
- container runtime and version
- reproduction steps
- expected vs actual behavior

## Versioning

Version comes from `git describe`:

- tagged commit: `v0.1.1`
- later commit: `v0.1.1-3-gead833b`
- local changes add `-dirty`

The Makefile handles version stamping automatically. The version string does not require a source edit.

## Releasing

Before tagging, update the [changelog](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with the release's user-facing changes and commit it.

```bash
git tag v0.1.2
git push origin master --tags
```

GitHub Actions builds release binaries, creates the GitHub release, and publishes the container image.
